/*
This file is a R project, reading the results of ELA with 4 feature values and classify the functions into preset categories.
A Neural Network will be trained to predict the categorization of functions.
The ELA data is stored in .csv file. The data import steps are obmitted here which can be easily done with RStudio
The ELA data from BBOB'09 benchmark function set is with the name: FourFeaturesData.csv

#set the category of 24 functions from BBOB'09:
FType <- c(1,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,2,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1)

#combine the ELA 4 features results with the function categories and set the name of each column:
FeatureData_Type <- cbind(FourFeaturesData, FType)
colnames(FeatureData_Type) <- c("hmax","ep_s","M0","ep_05","Type")

#To use Neural Network for classification, first we build the training and testing sets of data.
#Currently using the first 20 functions as training set and last 4 functions as testing set. Need to change to randome manner later
ELAtrainingset = FeatureData_Type[1:20,]
ELAtestingset = FeatureData_Type[21:24,]

#transform the type into binary coding by design matrix:
ELAtrainingmatrix <- model.matrix(~.,data=ELAtrainingset)
ELAtestinggmatrix <- model.matrix(~.,data=ELAtestingset)

#build NN:
ELAnn <- neuralnet(FType2+FType3 ~ hmax + ep_s + M0 + ep_05, data = ELAtraingingmatrix, lifesign = "full", hidden = 15, err.fct = "ce", linear.output = FALSE)
